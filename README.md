# LRU Cache

An implementation of a LRU cache. The cache supports `get`, `put`, and `remove` operations,
all of which are O(1). This crate was heavily influenced by the
[LRU Cache implementation in an earlier version of Rust's std::collections crate] (https://doc.rust-lang.org/0.12.0/std/collections/lru_cache/struct.LruCache.html).
